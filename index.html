                I am an third-year Electrical and Computer Engineering student at UT Austin with interests
                in software full-stack development, product management, and AI/ML! 
                I am very outgoing, and always willing to grab a meal and talk about anything with anyone! 
                Feel free to reach out to me anytime about anything! In my free time, I love to play basketball, tennis and violin.
